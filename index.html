<h2>Introduction</h2>

<article>
        <p>
          Photography is my favorite hobby because it helps me slow down and notice details I might
          otherwise miss. Light, texture, and the small moments that tell a bigger story. Whether I’m
          taking photos outdoors or documenting everyday life, photography helps me practice
          patience and creative decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page shares a quick overview of why I enjoy photography, the basic gear that helps,
          and a few beginner-friendly tips to improve results.

      <h2>Basic Gear</h2>

      <article>
        <p>
          You don’t need expensive equipment to begin. A smartphone camera can work very well.
          The most important “gear” is learning how to use what you have.
        </p>
<h3>Helpful starter items</h3>
<ul>
          <li>A phone or camera you can access easily</li>
          <li>Extra storage (memory card or cloud storage)</li>
          <li>A small tripod for sharp photos and low light</li>
          <li>A simple editing app for exposure and cropping</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Tips</h2>

<article>
<p>
          Improving photography usually comes down to intentional practice. These tips focus on
          fundamentals that work across all devices and camera types.
        </p>

        <h3>My go-to steps when taking a photo</h3>
        <ol>
<li>Check the background for distractions.</li>
<li>Find the best light (window light or shade outdoors).</li>
<li>Choose one clear subject and simplify the frame.</li>
<li>Take multiple shots from different angles.</li>
<li>Crop and adjust brightness slightly during editing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Subheading example (optional detail)</h3>
        <p>
          If the photo looks “flat,” try changing your position or moving the subject closer to a
          light source. Small changes often make the biggest difference.

          If you want structured learning, free online guides can help you understand exposure,
          composition, and basic editing workflows.
